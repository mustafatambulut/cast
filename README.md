# Chromecast Receiver Application with Mux Data Integration

This is a Chromecast receiver application built with React and integrated with Bitmovin Player and Mux Data for video analytics.

## Features

- **Bitmovin Player Integration**: High-quality video playback with DRM support
- **Mux Data Analytics**: Real-time video performance monitoring and analytics
- **Custom Branding**: Customizable branding overlay
- **Multi-play Detection**: Prevents simultaneous streaming sessions
- **DRM Support**: Widevine and PlayReady DRM protection

## Mux Data Integration

This application includes Mux Data SDK for monitoring video streaming performance. The integration provides:

- Buffering and startup time tracking
- Error monitoring and diagnostics
- Viewer engagement analytics
- Custom metadata tracking

### Setup Mux Environment Key

1. Get your Environment Key from [Mux Dashboard](https://dashboard.mux.com/environments)
2. Update the `.env` file with your Mux Environment Key:
   ```
   REACT_APP_MUX_ENV_KEY=your_actual_mux_env_key_here
   ```

### Mux Data Features

- **Debug Mode**: Set to `true` during development to see Mux logs in console
- **Custom Metadata**: Tracks video title, stream type, authentication status, and DRM protection
- **Player Information**: Automatically captures Bitmovin player version and configuration
- **Chromecast Specific**: Optimized for Chromecast receiver environment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
